## Introduction
[BlackjackReact](https://blackjackreact.onrender.com) is a simple Blackjack game developed in React. I created this game to display my understanding of React based sites, and my ability to use React as a framework. 

## Features
- **Endless play:** Allows the player to play endlessly against the dealer.
- **Draggable chips:** Allows users to play with their chips and stack them across the page.
- **No money or gambling:** Money/gambling was intentionally left out of this project. As such splitting cards, doubling down, insurance, and betting are not included features.

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and importantly React
2. **Backend:** No backend! This project is purely handled on the front-end

## Usage
To use the site, simply visit [BlackjackReact](https://blackjackreact.onrender.com). It's open to the public and free to use.
