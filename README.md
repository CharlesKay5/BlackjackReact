Blackjack React is program used to 

**Note:** There are two versions of this project: one that uses fetch requests to obtain data, and one that uses Puppeteer for web scraping. I opted for the fetch method because it's less intensive for the server to host, but I decided to keep the Puppeteer method in here because I enjoyed making it and didn't want it to go to waste.

## Features
- **Live Updating Data:** Displays each player's key stats in a tabulated format during a game.
- **Color Coding:** Allows users to color code players by clicking on their name and selecting a color from the tooltip. This can help differentiate players on your fantasy team, opponentâ€™s team, and Supercoach team.
- **Icons and Metrics:** Automatically displays icons for players who are on fire, running cold, injured, tagging, and more. Users can also manually add icons.
- **Live Chat:** Provides a platform for users to discuss the game in real time.
- **Scoring Timeline:** Shows the exact points scored by each player at specific times, helping users keep track of scoring contributions in detail.

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
3. **Database:** MongoDB
4. **API Calls:** Fetch
5. **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer
